# social-media-analysis-project
SQL-based Social Media (Instagram) Data Analysis project focusing on user engagement, content performance, and platform insights.

# Why I Built This Project?
This project was created to simulate a real-world business scenario where a data analyst is asked:
“What is actually working on social media, who is engaging, and how can a business improve performance using data?”

**Using pure SQL, I analyzed social media data to uncover user behavior patterns, post performance, and engagement trends, and translated them into clear business insights.**

# Project Objectives
- Understand user engagement behavior
- Identify top-performing posts
- Analyze platform-level trends
- Detect duplicate & inconsistent data
- Convert raw SQL output into actionable insights

# Tools & Technologies
- SQL – Core analysis & querying
- MS Excel – Supporting exploration
- PowerPoint – Insight storytelling
- GitHub – Project versioning & showcase

# Dataset Overview
- The dataset represents a simplified social media ecosystem, including:
- Users
- Posts
- Engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares)
- Platform-level activity

The data was analyzed using structured SQL queries, focusing on accuracy, clarity, and business relevance.

# Key Analysis Performed (SQL-Focused)
🔹 Data Quality Checks
Duplicate detection
NULL value identification
Data consistency validation

🔹 Engagement Analysis
Total & average engagement per post
User-level engagement behavior
High vs low performing content

🔹 Performance Insights
Most engaging posts
Users with highest activity
Platform-level engagement comparison

🔹 Trend Identification
Engagement patterns across users
Content effectiveness indicators
All queries are written with readability and logic clarity, simulating how SQL is used in real analytics teams.

# Key Insights
- A small percentage of posts drive majority of engagement
- Certain users show consistently high interaction behavior
- Engagement distribution is uneven, highlighting optimization opportunities
- Data cleaning significantly improves analysis accuracy

# Business Recommendations
- Focus on high-performing content formats
- Retarget highly engaged users
- Optimize posting strategy using engagement trends
- Regular data quality checks before analysis
